Here are some guidelines to help you get started

Username: Each user must have a username that is unique across all Salesforce organizations (not just yours).

Username Format: Users must have a username in the format of an email address (that is, jdoe@domain.com), but they don't have to use a real email address. (They can use their email address if they wish as long as their email address is unique across all Salesforce orgs.)

Email: Users can have the same email address across organizations.

Passwords: Users must change their password the first time they log in.

Login Link: Users can only use the login link in the signâ€“up email once. If a user follows the link and does not set a password, you (the admin) have to reset their password before they can log in.
