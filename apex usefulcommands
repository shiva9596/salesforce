in apex we real elements by using get() function.

we add elements after creating the list by calling add().

sObjects are created with tge new operator

generic sObjects can be created only through " new sObject"

fields of geenric sObject can be accessed only through the put() and get() methods.

DML:- Data Manipulation Language.
SOQL:- Salesforce object Query Language.

An account sObject is created first and then passed as an argument to the insert statement, which persists the record in Salesforce.

The upsert and merge statements are particular to Salesforce and can be quite handy.

The upsert DML operation creates new records and updates sObject records within a single statement, using a specified field to determine the presence of existing objects, or the ID field if no field is specified.

The merge statement merges up to three records of the same sObject type into one of the records, deleting the others, and re-parenting any related records.

When inserting records, the system assigns an ID for each record

Upsert Syntax :- upsert sObject | sObject[]  or upsert sObject | sObject[]​​ field

The josh variable is being reused for the upsert call.

If insert was used in this example instead of upsert, a duplicate Jane Smith contact would have been inserted.


You can delete persisted records using the delete statement

Upsert returns Database.UpsertResult objects, and delete returns Database.DeleteResult objects.

By default, the allOrNone parameter is true
