Set Your Org-Wide Sharing Defaults
Use org-wide defaults to specify the baseline level of access that the most restricted user should have.
In Setup, use the Quick Find box to find Sharing Settings.
Click Edit in the Organization-Wide Defaults area.

For each object, select the default access you want to give everyone.
To disable automatic access using your hierarchies, deselect Grant Access Using Hierarchies for any custom object that does not have a default access of Controlled by Parent.
By default, a role hierarchy automatically grants access to records for users above the record owner in the hierarchy. Setting an object to Private makes those records visible only to record owners and those above them in the role hierarchy. Use the Grant Access Using Hierarchies checkbox to disable access to records to users above the record owner in the hierarchy for custom objects. If you deselect this checkbox for a custom object, only the record owner and users granted access by the org-wide defaults receive access to the records.

Even if Grant Access Using Hierarchies is deselected, some users—such as those with the “View All” and “Modify All” object permissions and the “View All Data” and “Modify All Data” system permissions—can still access records they don’t own.
