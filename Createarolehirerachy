Define a Role Hierarchy

From Setup, use the Quick Find box to find Roles. 


Just under the company name, click Add Role. If the CEO role already exists, click Edit.

In the Label text box, enter CEO. The Role Name text box autopopulates with CEO.

In the "This role reports" to text box, click the lookup icon Lookup icon and click Select next to the name of your org.

By choosing the name of the org in the This role reports to text box, we’re indicating that the CEO role is a top-level position in our role hierarchy and doesn't report to anyone.

In the Role Name as displayed on reports text box, enter CEO. This text is used in reports to indicate the name of a role. 

Since a long role name, like Vice President of Product Development, takes extra space in your report columns, we recommend using a short but readable abbreviation.

Leave any other options, such as Opportunity Access, set to their defaults, and save. These access options don't have anything to do with our Recruiting app, 

and only appear if you have the org-wide defaults for a standard object set to a level more restrictive than Public Read/Write.

Now that you’ve created your first role, you can assign the appropriate user to it. Click CEO, and on the CEO role detail page, click Assign Users to Role.


In the Available Users drop-down list, select All Unassigned.

Choose a user from the list, and click Add to move her to the Selected Users for CEO list, then save.
